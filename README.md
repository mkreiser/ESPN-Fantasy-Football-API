A Javascript API client for both web and NodeJS that connects to the updated v3 ESPN fantasy football API. Available as an npm package.

## Features

* Supports pulling data from ESPN.
* Private league support (NodeJS version only, see [Important Notes](#important-notes)).
* Highly documented.
* Built for speed and efficiency with caching support.
* Built for extensibility by using ES6 classes.

## Documentation Reference

Hosted documentation available at http://espn-fantasy-football-api.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/.

## Installation

```
npm install --save espn-fantasy-football-api
```

There are four files exported in the package:

* `web.js` - Production file built for web environments (**main/default file**).
* `node.js` - Production file built for NodeJS environments.
* `web-dev.js` - Same as web, but not minified/obfused to make debugging/developing easier.
* `node-dev.js` - Same as node, but not minified/obfused to make debugging/developing easier.

## Important Notes

### ESPN Databases and Data Storage

This project simply retrieves data from ESPN and formats the responses in an easy to read and use format. ESPN is still responsible for maintaining and providing the data. Recently, many have noticed league data disappearing from previous years, including in other ESPN fantasy sports. This appears to be a result of ESPN deleting this data. While some data exists before 2017 (as of Feb. 1, 2019), some data (such as boxscores) is not longer available.

### ESPN API Changes

Since this project wraps the ESPN API, any breaking changes to the ESPN API will break this project. This occurred in February 2019 when ESPN migrated from their v2 API to a new v3 API (the original version of this project was completed in Janurary 2019). This project has been updated to consume ESPN's v3 API.

### Private Leagues

Private leagues currently only work with the NodeJS version of this project, due to limitations in setting headers in browsers.

## How to use

### ESPN API Conventions

* `leagueId` is the id for your league.
  * Example: `387659`
* `seasonId` matches the year in which the season was played.
  * Example: `2018`
* `matchupPeriod` refers to an entire match-up, including if the match-up lasts multiple weeks (not rare in playoff settings for smaller leagues).
  * Example: `3` refers to the third matchup in your league.
* `scoringPeriod` refers to a single NFL week. Since most matchups are 1 week long, the `scoringPeriod` will typically match the `matchupPeriod`. However, for multi-week matchups, `scoringPeriod` allows one to get information about a specific week in the match-up (useful in multi-week playoff match-up).
  * Example: `3` refers to the third week of the NFL season.
  * **Note**: A `scoringPeriodId` of `0` refers to the preseason before any games are played. A `scoringPeriodId` of `18` refers to the end of the season.

* If both a `matchupPeriod` and a `scoringPeriod` are used, the `scoringPeriod` takes precedence.

### Importing ESPN Fantasy Football API

```javascript
// ES6
import { ... } from 'espn-fantasy-football-api'; // web
import { ... } from 'espn-fantasy-football-api/node'; // node
import { ... } from 'espn-fantasy-football-api/web-dev'; // web development build
import { ... } from 'espn-fantasy-football-api/node-dev'; // node development build

// ES5
const { ... } = require('espn-fantasy-football-api'); // web
const { ... } = require('espn-fantasy-football-api/node'); // node
const { ... } = require('espn-fantasy-football-api/web-dev'); // web development build
const { ... } = require('espn-fantasy-football-api/node-dev'); // node development build
```

### How to Get Data

#### Creating a Client

This will allow you to call the various methods on the `Client` class to grab data for the passed league. For working with multiple leagues, create multiple `Client` instances.

```javascript
import { Client } from 'espn-fantasy-football-api';
const myClient = new Client({ leagueId: 432132 });
```

#### Working with Private Leagues

You'll need two cookies from ESPN: `espn_s2` and `SWID`. These are found at "Application > Cookies > espn.com" in the Chrome DevTools when on espn.com.

**Note**: As specified before, this functionality only works in NodeJS.

```javascript
myClient.setCookies({ espnS2: 'YOUR_ESPN_S2', SWID: 'YOUR_SWID' });
```
